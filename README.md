## Titanic Dataset Analysis Summary

Survival on the Titanic was strongly shaped by several factors, including gender, class, deck location, age, embarkation point, and family size. Based on the analysis:

- **Gender:** Females had a higher survival rate.
- **Class:** First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Deck Location:** Passengers assigned to Decks B, D, or E had significantly better chances.
- **Age:** Younger adults, especially those in their 20s, had increased likelihood of survival.
- **Embarkation Point:** Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (France) tended to have better outcomes.
- **Family Size:** A smaller family size was associated with higher survival rates.

For example, a first-class female passenger in her 20s, assigned to Deck B, D, or E, who embarked from Cherbourg and traveled with a small family, had the highest probability of survival.  
These findings highlight how social and structural factors shaped survival outcomes on the Titanic.
