# # Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Project Overview

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival. The analysis involves data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of survival factors such as gender, age, class, embarkation point, and deck.

Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicate rows.

Handled missing values in key columns (age, embarked, deck).

Merged related features for easier analysis.

Created new features such as family size and survival probability by group.

2. Data Visualization

A variety of plots were used to explore and understand survival patterns:

Bar Plots – compared survival by gender, class, and embarkation point.

Box Plots – examined age and fare distributions across survival outcomes.

Scatter Plots – visualized relationships between age, fare, and survival.

Heatmap – displayed correlations between numeric features.

Hexbin Plots – analyzed passenger distribution by age and fare.

KDE Plots – compared probability density of survival groups.

Key Insights

Gender: Females had a much higher chance of survival compared to males.

Class: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, while 3rd class had the lowest.

Embarkation Point: Passengers from Cherbourg (France) had higher survival probabilities, partly due to a larger proportion of wealthy travelers.

Deck: Decks B, D, and E were associated with better chances of survival.

Age: Younger adults, particularly those near their 20s, showed higher survival likelihood.

Family Size: Small families had better outcomes compared to those traveling alone or in large groups.

# Conclusion

From the Titanic dataset analysis, it can be observed that survival was strongly influenced by a combination of gender, class, deck location, age, embarkation point, and family size. In particular, a passenger who embarked from Cherbourg (France), was female, belonged to the 1st class, and was assigned to Deck B, D, or E had significantly better chances of survival. This likelihood increased further if the passenger was near her 20s and had a small family size. These findings highlight how social and structural factors shaped survival outcomes on the Titanic.
